# take-meowt-client

- An mobile application that aims to improve the adoption and retention rates of pets. Currently, we have only implemented the idea of adopting or rehoming a dog or a cat, with a possibility of rehoming alternative animals with future implementation. 

- Users arrive on a landing page where they choose whether they would like to rehome a dog or a cat. The user then goes through a in-depth preference form to be presented with their most suitable matches. 

- Users are then shown their most suitable matchess to choose from. Once chosen, they are directed to a individual profile of the animal, where they can confirm this is the pet they would like to rehome.
